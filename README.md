# Hough Transform
<img align="center" src="data/handout/ht.gif" width="500">

This repo contains a from-scratch implementation of hough transform. (Implemented as part of the Computer Vision course 16720B at CMU)

1. First, edge detection with Non-Maximal Suppression(to get sharper edges) is done. 
2. Hough transform with Non-Maximal Supression(to supress neighbouring hough lines) is applied on the edge magnitude image to identify the hough lines.
3. Intersection of hough lines and edges is visualized.
